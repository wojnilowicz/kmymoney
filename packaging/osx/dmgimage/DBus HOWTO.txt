DBus HOWTO
===================
This HOWTO is about getting DBus working on MacOS. Starting KMyMoneyNEXT should be possible without it, so this HOWTO could be omitted.
Steps presented here are supposed to be followed only once, so you can make subsequent updates to KMyMoneyNEXT and DBus set here should still be working.
First step is to copy service file by invoking command below in bash:

cp -fv /Volumes/KMyMoneyNEXT/kmymoney.app/Contents/Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents

Second step is to launch the service by command below:

launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist

The service will start automatically at each boot. In order to disable it invoke command below:

launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist

Troubleshooting
===================
If KMyMoneyNEXT hangs forever on splash screen, then run through checklist below.
1) Check if your kmymoney.app is in "/Applications" directory. It won't work if it's in e.g. "/Applications/KDE" directory
2) Check if "org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist" file is present in "~/Library/LaunchAgents" directory
3) Check if "org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist" contains
  a) /Applications/kmymoney.app/Contents/MacOS/dbus-daemon
  b) --config-file=/Applications/kmymoney.app/Contents/Resources/dbus-1/session.conf
  If it contains other paths or "--session" then it won't work
